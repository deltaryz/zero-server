# zero-server

Run with command `node zero-server.js`
Will serve on port 6969. Use [zero-client](https://github.com/techniponi/zero-client) on the client.

This project exists for me to experiment with HTTP requests and sqlite databases, as well as generally just being a fun way to use my pi zeros for _something_.

The actual functionality is currently not implemented yet, but I intend for this to be a fun way for my pi zeros to crunch numbers and/or simulate some kind of Tamagotchi-esque creatures that are amusing to keep track of.
